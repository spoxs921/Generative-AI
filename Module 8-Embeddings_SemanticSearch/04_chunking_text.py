# Module 08 - Embeddings & Semantic Search
# 8.5 Chunking Text for Embedding
# Real documents are too long to embed whole. Chunk them into pieces that fit
# within the embedding model's token limit (typically 512-8192 tokens
# depending on the model).
#
# This file is pure Python - no API key or network access needed to run it.

DOCUMENT = """
Large language models (LLMs) are neural networks trained on vast amounts of text data.
They learn to predict the next token in a sequence, which gives them broad language understanding.
Models like GPT-4 and Claude are examples of LLMs used in production today.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG, extends LLMs by connecting them to external knowledge bases.
Instead of relying solely on knowledge encoded during training, a RAG system retrieves relevant documents at inference time.
This allows the model to answer questions about recent events or private data it was never trained on.

The retrieval step in RAG typically uses embedding-based semantic search.
A query is embedded into a vector, and the nearest document vectors are retrieved from a database.
These documents are then injected into the LLM's context window alongside the query.
